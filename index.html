                <div class="junho2"> <strong>June 2, 2011:</strong> Winehouse checks out of the Priory Clinic, just days after checking in.

                <div class="junho18"><strong>June 18, 2011:</strong> Winehouse gives a disastrous performance in Belgrade in which she turned up late, forgot lyrics, wandered around the stage aimlessly and garnered boos from the crowd.</br></div>

                <div class="junho21"><strong>June 21, 2011:</strong> The troubled Brit calls off the remainder of her 12-date European tour following the Belgrade concert. Winehouse's rep, Chris Goodman, says the singer is withdrawing from all scheduled performances while she focuses on recovering.</br></div>

                <div class="julho23"><strong>July 23, 2011:</strong> 27-year-old Winehouse is found dead in her London home. The cause was later found out as being by accidental alcohol poisoning.</div>
